## What is in this archive?

  * `genomes/nonhybrids_and_outlier.txt` is the names of pure Saccharomyces and Non-Saccharomyces genomes in the dataset.
  * `genomes/nonhybrids.txt` is the names of pure Saccharomyces genomes in the dataset.
  * `genomes/hybrids.txt` is the names of hybrid Saccharomyces genomes in the dataset.
