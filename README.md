## What is in this archive?

1. `genomes` directory contains genomes and three txt files:

  * `genomes/nonhybrids_and_outlier.txt` is the names of pure Saccharomyces and Non-Saccharomyces genomes in the dataset.
  * `genomes/nonhybrids.txt` is the names of pure Saccharomyces genomes in the dataset.
  * `genomes/hybrids.txt` is the names of hybrid Saccharomyces genomes in the dataset.

2.  `gold.tree` is a newick file showing the gold standard phylogeny of pure yeast species.

# yeast genome-skims (yeast-genome-skims.tar.bz2)

1X-coverage paired-end simulated genome-skims of 8 nonhybrid Saccharomyces species 


1. `reads` directory contains fastq file containing 150bp reads. For each species, first and second mate pair fastq file is named with the suffix of `1` and `2` respectively.
